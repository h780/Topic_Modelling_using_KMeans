# Topic_Modelling_using_KMeans
In this project we will use unsupervised technique - KMeans, to cluster/ group reviews to identify main topics/ ideas in the sea of text. This will be applicable to any textual reviews. In this series, we will focus on twitter data which is more real world and more complex data compared to reviews obtained from review or survey forms.
